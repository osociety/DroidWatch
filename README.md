SmartWatch project using arduino and android. This project is built on android studio that provide android as platform to work
with the arduino platform. SmartWatch is project i'm influenced from the [tinkernut] (http://www.tinkernut.com/portfolio/make-smartwatch-old-cell-phone-part-1/). But i have used the oled screen as i'm not from electronics department and i was unable to solder the wires on the old cell phone oled screen.
